Emerging technologies, such as big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, help humans navigate the information age. 

Nevertheless, the very technologies have brought new challenges and concerns, such as **moral decisions and AI**, **legal decisions and AI**, interaction among **mentalizing, emotion and AI**, exploration **decision and anxiety** in the AI age.

In the AND lab, we aim at addressing these problems by combining **computational modeling**, **neuroscience** and **social psychology**. In particular, to examine **how intelligent products (e.g., big data algorithms) influence human decision-making**.

we will establish a data platform that allows us to test and analyze the public's psychological and behavioral states while interacting with AI algorithms. This novel data platform will enable us to investigate the behavior and neural mechanisms of human-human and human-AI interaction under the "human and digital society" framework and opens up new research directions at the intersection of psychology, neuroscience, and AI.

As part of [CCBS](https://ccbs.ici.um.edu.mo){:target="_blank"} at [University of Macau](https://um.edu.mo){:target="_blank"}, we are also interested in interaction of language, decision and neuroscience.
