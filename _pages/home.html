<p>Emerging technologies, such as big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence help humans navigate in the information age. 
    Nevertheless, the very technologies have brought new challenges and concerns, such as <strong>moral decisions and AI</strong>, 
    <strong>legal decisions and AI</strong>, interaction among <strong>mentalizing, emotion and AI</strong>, exploration <strong>decision and anxiety</strong> in the AI age.</p>
<p>In the A.N.D lab, we aim at addressing these problems by combining <strong>computational modelling</strong>, <strong>neuroscience</strong> and <strong>social psychology</strong>. 
    In particular, to examine <strong>how intelligent products (e.g., big data algorithms) influence human decision-making</strong>, 
    we will establish a data platform which allows us to test and analyse the public's psychological and behavioural states while they interact with AI algorithms. 
    This novel data platform allows us to investigate the behaviour and neural mechanisms of human-human and human-AI interaction 
    under the "human and digital society" framework and opens up new research directions at the intersection of psychology, neuroscience, and AI.</p>
<p>As part of <a href="https://ccbs.ici.um.edu.mo/" target="_blank">CCBS</a> at <a href="https://um.edu.mo/" target="_blank">University of Macau</a>, 
    we are also interested in interaction of language, decision and neuroscience.</p>
